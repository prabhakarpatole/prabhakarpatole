# Code-Assistant Maturity Tracker (Single Page Template)

This small single-page application (SPA) is a template to track engineer maturity levels for code-assistant usage.

Files added:
- `index.html` — SPA UI
- `styles.css` — basic styles and conditional formatting
- `app.js` — data loading and rendering logic
- `data.json` — sample data for 5 engineers and history snapshots

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve via a static server).
2. Edit `data.json` to update engineers or history. Refresh the page to see updates.

Formulas used:
- Percentage at level X: (count_at_level / total_engineers) * 100
- Progress: min(current_level / target_level, 1) * 100

Notes & next steps:
- You can extend the template with edit/add forms or persist changes to localStorage.
- For a richer trend chart, integrate Chart.js or D3 and map history snapshots into series.
